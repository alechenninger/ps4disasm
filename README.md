# PS4 Grand Cross modified ASM

https://ps4grandcross.net

This assembly is a modified version of the commonly used assembly for PSIV distributed by @lory90. It contains modifications for the Grand Cross mod programming, but does not contain the Grand Cross script, which is compiled with a toolchain involving [rune](https://github.com/alechenninger/rune).

This ASM is not tested on its own; it may not work in isolation.

Credit to @lory90 for original disassembly and bugfixes.
